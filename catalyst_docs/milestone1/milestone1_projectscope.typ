= Project Goal
#v(25pt)
The primary goal of the OpShin audit project is to enhance the reliability and
security of smart contracts developed using the OpShin language within the
Cardano ecosystem. This is achieved through a comprehensive audit that
identifies vulnerabilities, addresses edge cases, and optimizes the language's
efficiency. The project aims to
support developers with detailed documentation and best practices, ultimately
elevating the quality of smart contracts. The outcomes include a
significant reduction in reported vulnerabilities and the establishment of a
robust foundation for safe and trustworthy smart contract development on Cardano
using OpShin.

      following these integrations.
  - *Outcome*: This report will serve as a crucial resource for the OpShin team,
    guiding them in improving the OpShin language.

== Public Dissemination and Resolution of Remaining Issues
#v(5pt)
- *Deliverable*: *Finalized Audit Report and Presentation*
  - *Description*: The finalized audit report will be publicly shared, and the
    findings will be presented to the Cardano community.
  - *Key Activities*:
    - Publish the final audit report on the official Cardano forum, GitHub, and
      Medium.
    - OpShin Team will address remaining medium and low-priority findings from the report
      through pull requests, ensuring all issues are marked.
    - Produce a final close-out report summarizing the project outcomes and lessons
      learned.
    - Create a final close-out video to visually represent the projectâ€™s achievements
      and key takeaways.
  - *Outcome*: This will enhance community trust and engagement, Letting everyone
    know what's happening into the auditing process and supporting ongoing
    improvements in the OpShin language.

= Audit Objectives
#v(25pt)

1. *Comprehensive Audit of OpShin Language*: Conduct a thorough audit of the OpShin
  language used for smart contract development, ensuring meticulous scrutiny of
  the codebase to identify vulnerabilities and inefficiencies.

2. *Address Edge Cases and Optimize Efficiency*: Identify and address edge cases
  within the OpShin language to enhance the efficiency and reliability of smart
  contracts, thereby safeguarding user assets in the Cardano ecosystem.

3. *Engagement of Experienced Professionals*: Collaborate with auditors who have
  expertise in smart contract development to ensure a robust and informed auditing
  process.

4. *Facilitate the Auditing Process*: Provide detailed documentation that supports
  the auditing process, ensuring comprehensive coverage of potential edge cases
  and vulnerabilities.

5. *Enhance Quality and Security*: Elevate the quality of smart contracts written
  in OpShin, reinforcing Cardano's reputation as a secure and trustworthy
  blockchain platform.

6. *Support Openness and Teamwork*: Ensure clear communication and cooperation
  throughout the audit, taking advantage of OpShin's open-source nature to build
  trust and get the community involved.

== Area of Focus
#v(10pt)
As part of our auditing process, we will focus on ensuring that the outputs of
the smart contract compiler align precisely with the expected behavior defined
in the project specifications. The goal is to guarantee that the compiled smart
contracts, written in Python, execute exactly as they would in a standard Python
environment. This is critical, as the behavior of the compiled contract must
match the expectations set by the programmer.

Our manual code auditing is focused on a wide range of vectors, including but
not limited to:

- Evaluate the basic syntax and structure of the language.
- Check for consistency with the standard Python environment.
- Identify potential vulnerabilities in the language design.
- Evaluate built-in testing frameworks.
- Analyze the language's runtime performance.
- Evaluate memory management and resource utilization.
- Evaluate the completeness and quality of the standard library.
- Assess the availability and quality of third-party libraries.
- Evaluate the language's ability to handle large-scale projects.
- Review error handling mechanisms.
- Review the quality and completeness of official documentation.

= Audit Timeline
#v(10pt)

*Phase 1*:
Establishing communication channels and identifying time points where both teams
can allocate more time will support a healthier audit process and this has taken
us extra time, offering multiple timeslots for auditor-developer meetings. The
official audit process began at the end of October, instead of the originally
estimated September deadline for Milestone 1 submission.

*Phase 2*:
In the weeks 2-3, the audit team will have the Discovery and Planning phase
where they will get familiarized with the codebase and project specifications
which will cover milestone 2.

*Phase 3*:
Between the weeks 4-10, the auditors will conduct manual review and will perform
the following activities which will cover Milestone 3 and Milestone 4

- Perform an in-depth review of the code to identify vulnerabilities.
- Publish the initial findings report.
- Collaborate with the opshin team to gather feedback.
- OpShin team works on described issues and integrates feedback on them into the codebase.
- Integrate the feedback from the OpShin Team and produce a finalized audit report.

*Phase 4*:
The completion of final milestone will take around 1 week wherein the closeout
report and final audit report will be published.

= Operational Communication Channels
#v(10pt)
Effective communication is crucial for the smooth progression of the project and
ensures that all stakeholders are aligned throughout the audit process.
#v(5pt)
For this project, we have established *Discord* as the primary operational
communication channel with the Opshin team. Discord provides a flexible,
real-time platform for ongoing discussions, and quick resolution of queries.

*Direct Client Involvement*: The OpShin team is part of special channels, so
they can get updates, give feedback, and take part in discussions as the project
moves forward.

*Voice Calls*: For more detailed conversations, we use Google Meet for calls,
where we can discuss things in real-time and solve problems together.

*File Sharing*: Discord makes it easy to share files, documents, and images,
which helps the team exchange important materials and updates without any
hassle.

#v(25pt)
== Screenshots of Communication and Active Participation
#v(20pt)
To provide evidence of active communication, we have included screenshots of
Discord conversations that demonstrate active participation from both the OpShin
team and the audit team.
