= Project Goal

The primary goal of the OpShin audit project is to enhance the reliability and
security of smart contracts developed using the OpShin language within the
Cardano ecosystem. This is achieved through a comprehensive audit that
identifies vulnerabilities, addresses edge cases, and optimizes the language's efficiency. 
By emphasizing transparency and collaboration, the project aims to
support developers with detailed documentation and best practices, ultimately
elevating the quality of smart contracts. The anticipated outcomes include a
significant reduction in reported vulnerabilities and the establishment of a
robust foundation for safe and trustworthy smart contract development on
Cardano using OpShin.
