= Project Goal

The primary goal of the OpShin audit project is to enhance the reliability and
security of smart contracts developed using the OpShin language within the
Cardano ecosystem. This is achieved through a comprehensive audit that
identifies vulnerabilities, addresses edge cases, and optimizes the language's
efficiency. By emphasizing transparency and collaboration, the project aims to
support developers with detailed documentation and best practices, ultimately
elevating the quality of smart contracts. The anticipated outcomes include a
significant reduction in reported vulnerabilities and the establishment of a
robust foundation for safe and trustworthy smart contract development on Cardano
using OpShin.

== Specific Area of Focus
#v(10pt)
As part of our auditing process, we will focus on ensuring that the outputs of the smart contract 
compiler align precisely with the expected behavior defined in the project specifications. 
The goal is to guarantee that the compiled smart contracts, written in Python, execute exactly as 
they would in a standard Python environment. This is critical, as the behavior of the compiled 
contract must match the expectations set by the programmer.

Our manual code auditing is focused on a wide range of attack vectors, including
but not limited to:

1. Language Structure and Syntax
  - Evaluate the basic syntax and structure of the language
  - Check for consistency and clarity in language design
#v(10pt)
2. Security Features
  - Assess built-in security mechanisms
  - Identify potential vulnerabilities in the language design
#v(10pt)
3. Performance and Efficiency
  - Analyze the language's runtime performance
  - Evaluate memory management and resource utilization
#v(10pt)
// when we are auditing only the on chain point, should this point be included?
4. Compatibility and Interoperability
  - Check compatibility with other languages and systems
  - Assess ease of integration with existing codebases

= Operational Communication Channels
#v(10pt)
Effective communication is crucial for the smooth progression of the project and ensures that all stakeholders are aligned throughout the development process. 
For this project, we have established *Discord* as the primary operational communication channel with the client. Discord provides a flexible, real-time platform for ongoing discussions, quick resolution of queries, and coordination between teams and clients.

The key features of Discord that are being leveraged for this project include:

*Real-time Messaging*: Enables instant communication between project members and the client, facilitating quick decisions and clarifications.

*Voice and Video Calls*: For more complex discussions, we conduct calls via Google meet, which allows for immediate feedback and collaborative problem-solving.

*Direct Client Involvement*: The client is included in dedicated channels for real-time updates, feedback, and discussions. This fosters transparency and ensures that the client is involved at every step of the project.

*File Sharing*: Discord's ability to easily share files, documents, and screenshots allows for seamless exchange of project assets, updates, and deliverables.

== Screenshots of Communication and Active Participation
#v(10pt)
To ensure transparency and provide evidence of active communication, we have included screenshots of Discord conversations and interactions that demonstrate active participation from both the client and the development team. These screenshots capture:

*Client Queries and Feedback*: Active involvement from the client in discussing project milestones, providing feedback, and addressing concerns.

*Team Collaboration*: Regular discussions among team members regarding technical issues, updates, and progress reports.

*Milestone and Task Updates*: Key discussions surrounding project milestones, timelines, and deliverable updates.

These communication logs serve as documentation for the effective use of Discord as the operational communication tool for this project.
