= Project Goal

The primary goal of the OpShin audit project is to enhance the reliability and
security of smart contracts developed using the OpShin language within the
Cardano ecosystem. This is achieved through a comprehensive audit that
identifies vulnerabilities, addresses edge cases, and optimizes the language's
efficiency. By emphasizing transparency and collaboration, the project aims to
support developers with detailed documentation and best practices, ultimately
elevating the quality of smart contracts. The anticipated outcomes include a
significant reduction in reported vulnerabilities and the establishment of a
robust foundation for safe and trustworthy smart contract development on
Cardano.

= Project Deliverables
#v(20pt)
== OpShin Language Analysis
#v(5pt)
- *Deliverable*: *Detailed Analysis Report*
  - *Description*: The audit team will produce a comprehensive report that
    identifies vulnerabilities and areas for improvement within the OpShin language
    codebase.
  - *Key Activities*:
    - Utilize automated analysis tools to support findings.
    - Conduct unit tests to evaluate the functionality of the code.
    - Perform manual assessments to complement automated analyses.
  - *Outcome*: This report will serve as a foundational document for understanding
    the current state of the OpShin language and guiding future enhancements.

== Edge Case Identification
#v(5pt)
- *Deliverable*: *Documented List of Edge Cases*
  - *Description*: The audit team will compile a thorough list of edge cases
    relevant to the development of smart contracts using OpShin.
  - *Key Activities*:
    - Identify and document edge cases through extensive manual analysis.
    - Propose strategies for addressing these edge cases that can be applied in future
      iterations of the language.
    - Utilize tailored analysis tools to support the identification process.
  - *Outcome*: This documentation will provide valuable insights into potential
    pitfalls in smart contract development, helping developers avoid common errors.

#v(20pt)
== Draft Audit Report Preparation and Feedback Integration
#v(5pt)
- *Deliverable*: *Comprehensive Audit Report*
  - *Description*: The audit team will compile a detailed audit report that outlines
    identified vulnerabilities, recommended fixes, and best practices for the
    development of OpShin.
  - *Key Activities*:
    - Document vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations.
    - Collaborate with the OpShin team to integrate feedback and address reported
      issues in the codebase.
    - Ensure that the audit report reflects the most current state of the code
      following these integrations.
  - *Outcome*: This report will serve as a crucial resource for developers, guiding
    them in improving the reliability and security of smart contracts written in
    OpShin.

== Public Dissemination and Resolution of Remaining Issues
#v(5pt)
- *Deliverable*: *Finalized Audit Report and Presentation*
  - *Description*: The finalized audit report will be publicly shared, and the
    findings will be presented to the Cardano community.
  - *Key Activities*:
    - Disseminate the audit report through appropriate channels to ensure community
      access.
    - Present findings and recommendations in a format that encourages discussion and
      further inquiry.
    - Address remaining medium and low-priority findings from the report, ensuring all
      issues are resolved.
    - Produce a final close-out report summarizing the project outcomes and lessons
      learned.
    - Create a final close-out video to visually represent the projectâ€™s achievements
      and key takeaways.
  - *Outcome*: This will enhance community trust and engagement, providing
    transparency into the auditing process and supporting ongoing improvements in
    the OpShin language.
